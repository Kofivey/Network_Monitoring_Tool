# Network_Monitoring_Tool

The aim of the project is to create a user friendly gui network monitoring tool.
Users will be able to select icons to represent nodes and give names to the node and also the ip addresses of the nodes.

Nodes will be monitored via ICMP and users will be alerted when node is unreachable via several mechanism such as color coding and sound.
